My solution to the Go Problem Sheet found at https://data-representation.github.io/problems/go-fundamentals.html

# Installation and Testing
To build the following .go files, simply download Go from https://golang.org/ and install it.

1. Open a command prompt

2. Navigate to the folder your .go file in in, e.g C:\Users\Eddie\College\Year3\GoLanguage\src\github.comEddieEldridge\Problem1
and run the 'Go Build' command. This will create an executable file in the folder which you can then launch in the terminal by simply typing the name of the executable. (Note: The name of the executable will match the name of the folder, NOT the name of the .go file)

3. If you would like to make changes to your file simply type, 'Go Clean' to delete the exe and rebuild it using 'Go Build' when you are ready to build your changed code
